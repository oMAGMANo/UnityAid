## 🚀 How UnityAid Works

UnityAid simplifies the entire process for event organizers, donors, and volunteers alike.

First, you can effortlessly upload all the details of your event—think descriptions, dates, locations, and goals. Your event then gets a dedicated page with eye-catching visuals and a progress bar showing funds raised and volunteer sign-ups.

Supporters can contribute directly through our secure payment gateways, and they aren’t limited to just financial donations. Volunteers can sign up to offer their time and skills, helping to bring your event to life.

Social media integration is a breeze, letting you easily share your event across platforms and rally more support.

Our seamless payment system makes donating quick and easy, so nothing stands in the way of your community getting the help it needs.
